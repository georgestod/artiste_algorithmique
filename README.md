# un·e artiste algorithmique

In a recent book (1) , the question of whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can produce authentic artists is raised. If we follow Maggie Boden's definition, art should be a creation which is "new, surprising and meaningful". Can mere lines of code produce something alike?

There are two aspects we focus on: first \which technologies can help creating new paintings from past creations. Secondly, we question what could be the impact of social networks as a mean to connect an audience with the creations of an algorithm. Creating something meaningful as required per Boden's definition is the hardest part of the work and will remain an open question. Nevertheless, an algorithmic artist is prototyped see: https://twitter.com/IaQuinet. The name is inspired from the Belgian painter \textit{Mig Quinet} (1906-2001).
