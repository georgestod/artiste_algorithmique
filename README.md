# artiste_algorithmique

In a recent book\footnote{Bersini H., \textit{Lâ€™intelligence artificielle peut-elle engendrer des artistes authentiques ?}, Academie Royale de Belgique, 2020}, the question of whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can produce authentic artists is raised. If we follow Maggie Boden's definition, art should be a creation which is "new, surprising and meaningful". Can mere lines of code produce something alike?
\\
There are two aspects we focus on: first \textit{which technologies can help} creating new paintings from past creations. Secondly, we question what could be the \textit{impact of social networks} as a mean to connect an audience with the creations of an algorithm. Creating something \textit{meaningful} as required per Boden's definition is the hardest part of the work and will remain an open question. Nevertheless, an \textit{algorithmic artist} is prototyped see \footnote{The computations behind imply the use of a GPU - to save resources the prototype is not online at all times.}: \url{ https://twitter.com/IaQuinet}. The name is inspired from the Belgian painter \textit{Mig Quinet} (1906-2001).
